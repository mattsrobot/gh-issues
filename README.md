# Welcome to a ⚡️ GitHub Issues Client

The goal of this project is to build a nice GitHub issues client that's super fast and keeps in sync with changes in real-time (ish).

## Setup

Include a .env file with a valid GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN. You'll need to generate this from GitHub > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (Classic).

## Development

Start the development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

There is an included Dockerfile which will deploy and run on Railway.app without a problem.
